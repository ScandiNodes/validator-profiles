# BTC.Secure

Staking-as-a-Service provider with priority in speed, security and reliability. Operated by BTC.Secure Inc.

## Team

We love new technologies and believe that the right use of technology can change the world and make people's lives better.

For our company, blockchain has become such a technology. We have been working in the field of digital finance and assets for more than 3 years. We started with the cryptocurrency exchange activity, where the main principles for us were **security** and **reliability**.

Bitcoin (BTC) — is the first cryptocurrency, it was with him that we interacted and learned to provide customers with the most reliable exchange service.

Hence, our brand — **BTC.Secure**, which literally means "Bitcoin + security/reliability", was born, and since Bitcoin has now become almost a symbol of the blockchain and everything connected with it, the meaning of our brand can be translated as "Digital currencies and assets in safe hands".

**Our mission:** Improve the quality of communication and exchange of values with the help of blockchain technology.

We create and maintain highly accessible infrastructure for blockchain networks based on Proof-of-Stake technology and now work in the **Minter**, **Terra** and **IRIS** blockchains with a total stake of more than $10,000,000 from ~1,000 clients who trust us with their digital assets.

We are legally registered in the United States as **BTC.Secure Inc.** in the State of Delaware, and we conduct our business in **full compliance with the law**.

Staking does not imply direct management of customer funds, but requires us, as a staking provider, to maintain 100% of the working infrastructure under any load in the blockchain. After all, our activity depends on how fast and stable the blockchain will work, and, as a result, the amount of income of our clients.

The United States currently has the best legislation in the crypto industry, and that's why we, like many of the most successful projects, are located there.

**This once again underlines our high standards:** Reliability and safety without compromise.
